        <p>The balsamic reduction in this recipe is a great one to add to your arsenal because it is a secret weapon for
            wickedly delicious super fast meals (GREAT with chicken!). Use as a drizzle to fancy things up – just like
            restaurants do!</p>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="lists">
        <li>4 (5 ounce) bone-in pork chops, 3/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup good quality balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Directions</h2>
    <ul class="procedure">
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Pat pork chops dry with paper towels, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Melt butter in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil and stir to combine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>When butter and oil shimmer, carefully add chops and cook over medium heat until browned on one side, 5
                to 6 minutes. Turn and cook pork chops until no longer pink in the center and browned on the other side,
                3 to 4 minutes. Do not overcook the chops or they will turn dry and hard. An instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Remove pork chops from heat and cover to keep warm.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Combine chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, and honey in a small saucepan. Bring glaze to a boil over
                medium-high heat and boil until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, 5 to 6 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Drizzle pan-fried chops with balsamic glaze and serve warm.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
